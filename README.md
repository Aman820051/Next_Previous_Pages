# Next_Previous_Pages

1. **Set up your React.js project**: First, make sure you have a React.js project set up. You can do this using Create React App or any other method you prefer.

2. **Define your data structure**: Determine how you're going to store your data. For example, if you're fetching data from an API, think about how you'll store the current page of data and how you'll navigate between pages.

3. **Render the initial data**: When your component mounts, fetch the initial data (for the first page) and display it in your component.

4. **Implement Next and Previous buttons**: Add buttons or links for Next and Previous pages in your component's render method.

5. **Handle Next and Previous button clicks**: Add event handlers to your Next and Previous buttons. When the Next button is clicked, update the component state to fetch the next page of data and update the UI accordingly. Similarly, when the Previous button is clicked, update the component state to fetch the previous page of data and update the UI.

6. **Update the UI**: Whenever the state changes (i.e., when you fetch new data), update the UI to reflect the changes. This might involve re-rendering a list of items or updating other parts of your component.

7. **Handle edge cases**: Consider edge cases such as what to do when there is no next or previous page, or how to handle errors when fetching data.

8. **Test your implementation**: Make sure to test your Next and Previous page buttons to ensure they work as expected in different scenarios, such as navigating between pages or handling errors.
